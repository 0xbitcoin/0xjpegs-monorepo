### Todo  
  
 
- add names to keys  (allow for editing the name on the show page ) 

-show Created At for keys 
  
-allow for deleting a key that is your own 



-add unit tests 
-make sure we can handle emojis, $ ,  (the stuff that errors) 


 

- apply updates to registrant and controller (how)
(transfer event changes teh registrant)


-try to fix more of teh erroring domains (indexer) ðŸ¥’ðŸ¥’

-make sure my sanitization is not breaking the emoji domains !! **


 



### BUGS 
- the top navbar looks bad  on mobile 
- docs look bad on mobile 




 




SIDE NODES
- put the indexer into a molecular service 
- test with peperares.eth on goerli 



### BUGS 
 


 ## DEVOPS LATER 
 Set up dedicated indexing servers for goerli data and for mainnet data 
 Set up a dedicated server for the backend -- this talks to the mongo servers via ssh keys or whatever
